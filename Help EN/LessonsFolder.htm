<h4>Lessons Folder</h4>

<p>Selection of the folder where to store chess lessons. These lessons have a *.XPGN, *.PGN or *.CPS extension.</p>
<p>When selecting a new location for the lesssons, the lessons from the old location are copied into the new location. If a lesson-file already exists at the new location, a question is raised if the the file at the new location should be overwritten.
</p>
<p>After installation of the application, the lessons are located at "My Documents\Demoboard Lessen". Copying the files onto an USB (for using at a places where DemoBoard is not installed; such as DigiBoards at schools) expects the files to be in the "\Demoboard Lessen"-folder at the place where the "DemoBoard.exe" is run from.
