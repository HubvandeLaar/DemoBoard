<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Since quite some time many chess trainings are based upon the Dutch <a href="https://www.stappenmethode.nl">‘Stappen Methode’</a>, 
a profound method with instructor materials and booklets with exercises for the pupils. 
The booklets contain diagrams with pieces marked with a rectangle or circle. 
There are several chess-programs suited for usage with a digiboard, but none with rectangles.
Also the PGN-file does not provide for black dots, circles and rectangles. See also : <a href="Setup%20Toolbar.htm">Setup Toolbar<a>
</p>
<p>You are welcome to use this application as intended.
The application is designed to be used by chess trainers.
<ul>
<li>As a digitial demo board</li>
<li>With quick setup using the keyboard</li>
<li>Show games of children (so strange moves can also be stored)</li>
<li>Lessons can be saved as XPGN, PGN or CPS</li>
<li>Lessons can also be saved as PDF (for printout)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Feedback is welcome, but I don't accept any resposibilities about damages caused by this application.
