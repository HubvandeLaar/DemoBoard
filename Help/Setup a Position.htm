<h1>Chess Board</h1>
<h2>Setup a Position</h2>

<p>To setup a new position drag and drop pieces and ‘Graphical Elements’ from the Setup Toolbar onto the board. Dragging and dropping pieces removes all moves from the Move List. Click the ‘Color Indicator’ ( little square at the right-top-side) to change colour to move.</p>

<p>When a field contains both a graphical element (such as a green rounded rectangle and a piece), click at the centre of the field to select the piece and select closer to the border to select the graphical element.

<p>Setup can also be done quite fast by pointing the mouse to the 
position and entering the character of the piece on the keyboard.</p> 
<p>Just enter ‘k’, ‘q’, ‘r’, ‘b’, ‘n’ and space to insert a king, queen, 
rook, bishop, knight or pawn at the mouse-position. When language 
is ‘Nederlands’, enter ‘k’, ‘d’, ‘t’, ‘l’, ‘p’, and space. 
Depending on the ‘Active Color’ on the upper right side of the board, 
pieces are inserted as white or black. Click the ‘Active color indicator’ 
to switch color. Press ‘Del’-key to delete pieces.</p>
<p>Right clicking on a field of the chess board shows a menu 
with options to add pieces and text or delete the piece and 
graphical elements present at the field.
